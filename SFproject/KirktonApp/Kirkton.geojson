          "description": "This is an Ethernet connected RisingHF25008 LoRaWAN Gateway at the SRUC Hill & Mountain Research Centre office at Kirkton. The gateway receives messages from the sensors located across the farm (within an approximate 10 km radius) and forwards them to the Network Server. The gateway is simply a packet forwarding device, it doesnâ€™t understand the packet contents, or decide what to send back, this is handled by the Network Server. The Network Server is responsible for receiving multiple copies of the transmitted packets, decrypting them and removing duplicates, and then forwarding the payloads to whatever Application Server the end user requires. We use 'The Things Network' (TTN) as our Network Server. For most of our environmental sensors we use an Application Server provided by Decentlab, who are the sensor manufacturers. We are able to view the data on a Dashboard provided by Decentlab.",
