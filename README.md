# SmartFarm

Repository for thesis code, building a dashboard to display data from various environmental sensors.

Using a map as the main landing page, this application gives visual meaning to the data collected at Kirkton Farm through the map and graph views. The map combines different brands of sensors, and shows their location.

A pop-up can be seen when a sensor is interacted with, either as a marker on the map or in the sidebar view.




A graph overview page can be viewed, showing recent data.

The application has user authentication. Authenticated users have the option to download data to csv file. Only authenticated users can add new user profiles. This stops public users from being able to create accounts and log in.
